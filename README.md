# periodic-aperiodic-LIFE

<p>These are the data analysis codes for the Cesnaite et al. paper "Alterations in rhythmic and non-rhythmic resting-state EEG activity and their link to cognition in older age"</p>

**MATLAB codes** folder contains codes that were used to estimate periodic and aperiodic resting-state EEG parameters as well as their correlations with age. We used EEGLAB toolbox (version 14.1.1b) and custom written scripts.

**R codes** folder consists codes that were used for Exploratory factor analysis as well as modesl for Multiple linear regression.
