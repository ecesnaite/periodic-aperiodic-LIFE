# periodic-aperiodic-LIFE

<p>These are the data analysis codes for the Cesnaite et al. paper "Alterations in rhythmic and non-rhythmic resting-state EEG activity and their link to cognition in older age"</p>

**MATLAB codes** folder contains codes that were used to estimate periodic resting-state EEG parameters as well as their correlations with age. Here we used EEGLAB toolbox (version 14.1.1b) and custom written scripts. 

<p>Aperiodic component was estimated using FOOOF toolbox (fooof-tools.github.io/) described in the paper by T. Donoghue et al., “Parameterizing neural power spectra into periodic and aperiodic components,” Nature Neuroscience, vol. 23, no. 12, Dec. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41593-020-00744-x.</p>

**R codes** folder consists codes that were used for Exploratory factor analysis as well as Multiple linear regression models.
